Friday is a 1982 science fiction novel and early cyberpunk by Robert A. Heinlein.

It is the story of a female "artificial person," the eponymous Friday,
genetically engineered to be stronger, faster, smarter, and generally better than normal humans.

Artificial humans are widely resented, and much of the story deals with Friday's struggle both against
prejudice and to conceal her enhanced attributes from other humans. The story is set in a Balkanized world,
in which the nations of the North American continent have been split up into a number of smaller states.
